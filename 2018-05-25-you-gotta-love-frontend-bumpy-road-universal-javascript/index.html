    ## Journey<br>preparations

    ---
    layout: true
    class: theme-whiskey, slides-centered
    ---

    ### What's Universal JavaScript?

    ---

    <div style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: url(assets/iss.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; background-position: center center; margin: 0;"></div>

    ???

    - Does it mean that it's supposed to run on the ISS?

    ---

    The term is used to describe a special type of **web application**.

    ---

    It means that the application code is written in a way that it can be executed<br>
    **both on the server and on the client**.

    ---

    ### How does it work?

    ---

    The server renders the **initial HTML** and sends it to the browser.

    ---

    The browser **displays the initial HTML**.

    ---

    Simultaneously, it also **downloads the single-page app** (SPA) in the background.

    ---
    
    Once the client-side code is ready, the client takes over and **the website becomes a SPA**.

    ---

    This is called (re-)hydration.

    ---

    ### Why would we want to do that?

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-chapter, theme-spinach
    ---

    ## Reason № 1:<br>Performance

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    .slides-content[
    - With server-side rendering, the first meaningful paint happens sooner
    - We're leveraging one of HTML's strengths: progressive rendering
    - Browsers are incredibly good at rendering partial content
    - With SPAs, we throw all of these builtin performance optimizations away
    ]

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-chapter, theme-spinach
    ---

    ## Reason № 2:<br>SEO

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    .slides-content[
    - Search engine crawlers used to not execute scripts
    - Nowadays, they execute initial scripts
    - But they usually stop after a while (roughly 10 seconds)
    - SPAs can't set meaningful HTTP status codes
    ]

    **The website stays usable**<br>even if scripts weren't loaded, blocked or failed in some other way.

    ---

    <img src="assets/livewire-book.jpg" style="width: 400px;">

    ???

    - Back in 1995, Netscape also released a server-side JavaScript implementation which they called LiveWire

    ---

    <img src="assets/example-livewire.jpg" style="width: 600px;">

    ???

    - You could add server tags which were executed on the server
    - But the idea didn't really take off

    ---

    <img src="assets/livewire-review.jpg" style="width: 800px;">

    ???

    - I came across this particular review from a developer in 1998
    - "I spent 18 months doing LiveWire development and it's pretty lame. I hit the wall of scripting languages' limitations quickly and even though LiveWire in Enterprise Server 3 added a lot of stuff, it still sucks. For this reason I have dedicated a whole page on my personal site to describing why LiveWire sucks"

    ---

    Universal JavaScript can be **very challenging**.

    - Universal JavaScript can be very challenging
    - I decided to show you some of the pitfalls

    ## Let's start the journey

    ???

    - How do you build a universal web application?

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    ### From SPA to Universal

    <img src="assets/url-qr-code.jpg" width="300">

    The full journey is available at:<br>
    [https://github.com/jhnns/bumpy-road-to-universal-javascript](https://github.com/jhnns/bumpy-road-to-universal-javascript)

    ???

    - I'm going to explain typical challenges of universal applications by transforming a single-page app to a universal app
    - But I had to skip some parts because it wouldn't fit into the schedule
    - The full journey is available at https://github.com/jhnns/bumpy-road-to-universal-javascript
    - Of course, there are multiple solutions for the problems presented here
    - The following solutions are just my recommendation
    - Please note: You won't be able to measure a big performance difference between the SPA and the universal app in my example project because the JavaScript bundle is too small
    - The positive effects becomes obvious with bigger bundles and on weak CPUs

    ---

    <video src="assets/spa-demo.mp4" controls loop width="640" height="424"></video>

    ???

    - Our current single-page app is a an app that displays a random fox image
    - It fetches the URL for the random image from a remote API
    
    ---

    <img src="assets/webpack-logo.svg" width="450" style="display: inline-block; position: relative; top: 30px; margin-left: -70px;">
    <img src="assets/babel-logo.png" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: -20px;">
    <img src="assets/react-logo.svg" width="150" style="display: inline-block; position: relative; top: -20px;">

    ???

    - The tech stack is React, webpack and babel
    - But that doesn't really matter. You can apply the learnings to different tech stacks as well

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-server.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - The app has an express server

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-server-api-fox.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - The server handles API requests for the random fox image because we can't just make a request to a different origin from the client

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-server-index-html.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - The server serves the empty HTML that is typical for a SPA

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-app.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - There is a single App component which renders the application

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-app-will-mount.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - Once the application is mounted into the DOM, the client requests the image from our express server
    - Which proxies it to the remote API

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-app-render.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - As long as the API call is pending, we display a loading message

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-start.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - Inside start.js we call ReactDOM.render() with the application

    ---

    ## Challenge № 1:<br>The node-browser gap

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    .slides-columns[
    .col[
    <img src="assets/nodejs-logo.jpg" height="100" style="margin-right: 100px">

    - CommonJS (CJS)
    - Core modules
    ]
    .col[
    <img src="assets/browser-logos.jpg" height="100">

    - ECMAScript modules (ESM)
    - No core modules
    ]
    ]

    ???
    
    - node and browsers are inherently different platforms
    - In node, we have CommonJS and core modules like the fs module for instance
    - In browsers, we have the ECMAScript module system and no core modules

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### The good news

    Both platforms are getting more and more similar.
    ]

    ---

    <img src="assets/parse-domain-example.jpg" width="800" />

    ESMs and the `URL` constructor, for instance, will soon be available on both platforms.

    ???

    - We get ECMAScript modules into node
    - Useful, standardized APIs, like the URL constructor, are being implemented for both platforms

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### The bad news

    We're not there yet.
    ]

    ---

    <img src="assets/app-problem.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - In fact, our App component is neither executable in the browser nor in node

    ---

    <img src="assets/app-problem-import.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Although ECMAScript modules are soon available for both platforms, bare import specifiers are not yet standardized
    - Bare import specifier are the ones you use to import stuff from node_modules
    - And importing images like that is supported nowhere
    - There was some specification efforts on a loader spec, but things are still in flux

    ---

    <img src="assets/app-problem-jsx.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Custom syntax like JSX or vue-files makes developing web applications easier
    - But now we need a build tool to translate these languages

    ---

    ### ☝️ Solution

    ---

    Use a bundler to **streamline the module system and platform environment**.<br>
    Create a bundle for both the browser and for node.

    ---

    <img src="assets/webpack-config-array.jpg" width="800" />
    
    ???

    - With webpack, you can also return an array of configs
    - This switches webpack into the multi-compiler mode

    ---

    <img src="assets/webpack-config-web.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Create one config for the browser with target "web"

    ---

    <img src="assets/webpack-config-node.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Create one config for node with target "node"
    - Use "commonjs2" as library target to make the bundle requireable in node
    - Use the externals option to skip dependencies in node_modules
    - You can use the webpack-node-externals package on npm to simplify that

    ---

    Use or write **isomorphic modules**.<br>

    ---

    <img src="assets/isomorphic-fetch-on-npm.jpg" width="1000" />

    ???

    - Isomorphic modules are modules that expose the same public API, but different implementations under the hood
    - Example: isomorphic fetch

    ---

    <img src="assets/isomorphic-fetch-package-json.jpg" width="1000" />

    ???

    - These modules have different entrypoints depending on the environment
    - main for node and browser for... the browser

    .slides-columns[
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-right: 150px;">

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">
      <span style="font-size: 150px;">🤹‍♀️</span><br>
      <b>Server</b><br>
      Multiple users
    </div>
    ]

    ???

    - The client is a single-user environment
    - The server is a multi-user environment
    - The server serves multiple users at the same time
    - There is also another difference between the client and the server

    ---

    .slides-columns[
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-right: 150px;">
      <span style="font-size: 2em">👩‍💻</span><br>

      <span style="font-size: 2em">🤹‍♀️</span><br>
      <b>Server</b><br>
      Sends HTML<br>

      <span style="font-size: 150px;">📝</span>
    </div>
    ]

    ???

    - The result of a client render is an update of the DOM tree
    - The result of a server render is an HTML string

    ---

    ### ☝️ Solution

    ???

    - The solution for these two problems

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Keep the process stateless.<br>
    Maintain the application state for each request.

    **Design the app in a way that it can be used by multiple users at the same time.**
    ]

    ???

    - Keep the process stateless
    - Maintain the application state for each request
    - Design the app in a way that it can be used by multiple users at the same time

    ---

    .slides-columns[
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-right: 50px;">
      <span style="font-size: 2em">👩‍💻</span><br>
      <b>Client</b><br>

      <span style="font-size: 150px;">🚪</span>

      <span style="font-size: 2em">🤹‍♀️</span><br>
      <b>Server</b><br>

      <span style="font-size: 150px;">🚪</span>
    </div>
    ]

    Create **two app entries**,<br>
    a client entry and a server entry.

    ???

    - Create two app entries, one for the client and one for the server
    - This is where you can add platform-dependent and environment-dependent code

    ---

    <img src="assets/two-entries-server.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - In our case, we split up start.js into start.server.js and start.client.js
    - start.server.js exports a function that renders the application to a string

    ---

    <img src="assets/two-entries-index-js.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Instead of a simple index.html we now got a index.html.js with a template string

    ---

    <img src="assets/two-entries-index-js-require.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Which requires the server bundle

    ---

    <img src="assets/two-entries-index-js-app.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - And embeds the rendered app into the index.html template

    ---

    <img src="assets/two-entries-client.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - start.client.js rehydrates the application from the given HTML
    - Update your webpack config accordingly

    ---

    ---

    ## Challenge № 3:<br>Data fetching

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    **Data fetching** needs to be executable<br>
    on both the client and the server.

    ???

    - Data fetching needs to be executable on both the client and the server.

    ---

    ### Why?

    ---

    <div style="font-size: 50px">
      <span style="margin-left: 1em">🤹‍♀️</span>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em">👩‍💻</span>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em">👩‍💻</span>

      <span style="margin-left: 2em">💬</span>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em">💬</span>
    </div>

    - The **initial request** will be handled on the server
    - **Subsequent requests** (navigation events) will be handled on the client
    - The initial request can be any route

    ???

    - The initial request will be handled on the server
    - Subsequent requests (navigation events) will be handled on the client
    - The initial request can be any route

    ---

    ### How?

    ---

    - E.g. use [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to make the `fetch()` API available in node
    - Cross-origin requests may need to be proxied via your API
    - Use absolute URLs to fetch data from your own API

    ???

    - For instance use node-fetch on the server
    - Cross-origin requests may need to be proxied via your API
    - Use absolute URLs to fetch data from your own API

    ---

    <img src="assets/thinking.jpg" style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%;" />

    ---

    .slides-content[
    **Yes.**

    Your server may end up doing an HTTP request against itself. But that's fine, really.
    ]

    .slides-footnote[
    If you're using GraphQL, you could use the [SchemaLink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/schema.html) instead of the HttpLink.
    ]

    ???

    - Yes, your server may end up doing an HTTP request against itself
    - But that's fine, because you may decide to separate the data API and the HTML server later
    - GraphQL provides a way to circumvent that

    ---

    ### There's another problem

    ???

    - But there's another problem

    ---

    <img src="assets/loading-state-html.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - If we'd execute the current state of the app, we would get the following HTML from the server

    ---

    <img src="assets/spa-app-will-mount.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - This is because we're fetching the data on componentDidMount()
    - But rendering is synchronous (at least for now)
    - When the server sends out the HTML, the app is still fetching

    ---

    ### ☝️ Solution

    ---

    **Multiple** render passes?

    ???

    - We could call render multiple times until all componentDidMount() hooks fired
    - But that feels kind of hacky
    - We would also need to define a maximum number of rendering passes

    ---

    **Better:** Separate data fetching from rendering

    ???

    - Separate data fetching from rendering

    ---

    <img src="assets/data-fetching-static.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Make it a static function
    - Return props instead of calling setState()
    - This is similar to what Next.js is doing with getInitialProps()

    ---

    <img src="assets/data-fetching-await-result.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Call the static function, await the result and render

    ---

    <img src="assets/actual-ssr.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Now the server renders the final HTML
    - Which brings us to the next Challenge

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-chapter, theme-spinach
    ---

    ## Challenge № 5:<br>State dehydration<br>and rehydration

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    <img src="assets/react-error.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - With the current app, the client would show us a warning

    ---

    <img src="assets/ssr-vs-csr.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - It is caused by the fact that the client is rehydrating the app with different props
    - We somehow need to make the props from the server available to the client

    ---

    <img src="assets/state-start-server.jpg" width="800" />

    ???
    
    - So we refactor the start.server.js to return the HTML and the state

    ---

    <img src="assets/state-index-js-xss.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - And embed the stringified application state into the initial HTML

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-chapter, theme-danger
    ---

    ## 🚨 XSS ALARM 🚨

    ???

    - But now we have a a cross-site scripting vulnerability

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    <img src="assets/xss.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - The state may contain user data
    - If the user data contains HTML, the browser will interpret it

    ---

    <img src="assets/xss-exec.jpg" width="800" />

    ---

    <img src="assets/state-index-js-safe.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - Replacing opening brackets with their unicode counterpart prevents this kind of attack

    ---

    <img src="assets/state-start-client.jpg" width="800" />

    ???

    - On the client-side, we can re-use the preloaded state to hydrate the app with the same state as on the server

    - The term was originally coined to describe the feeling of unease people get when a robot tries to resemble humans too closely
    - With server-rendered apps, the uncanny valley describes the time span during the website looks usable, but does not respond to user interactions

    - Big response size meaning that the HTTP response took too long to transfer
    - Big parse size meaning that the decompressed source code took too long to parse

    ### ☝️ Solution

    ---

    `npm rm ...`

    `import(...)`

    `&lt;a href="...">`

    1. Replace unnecessarily big dependencies
    2. Delay dependencies that are not immediately required
    3. Use `&lt;a>` tags instead of click handlers

    - While the scripts are loading and being parsed, our web application should already be usable

    Consequently,<br>
    **every meaningful UI state should have a URL.**

    - However, this requires that every meaningful UI state has a URL

    - For instance, if you want to open a modal, use a URL with a query parameter

    There are also other advantages:

    - The back button just works
    - Open in new tab just works
    - Better accessibility

    ## Challenge № 7:<br>Response streaming

    layout: true
    class: slides-centered, theme-whiskey
    ---

    <img src="assets/network-no-streaming.jpg" width="1000">

    ???

    - As long as we're waiting for the data to be loaded, we keep the client pending
    - I've delayed the response time artificially to demonstrate the effect
    - We could already send some static parts of the document head

    ---

    ### ☝️ Solution

    ---

    Write the server entry in a way that allows you to<br>
    send out parts of the document **as soon as they are final.**

    - Write the server entry in a way that allows you to send out parts of the document as soon as they are final

    ---

    <img src="assets/streaming-start-server.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - So in our case, the server entry would return an object with promises

    ---

    <img src="assets/streaming-index-html-js.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - Then in the index.html.js

    ---

    <img src="assets/streaming-index-html-js-await.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - We start the app by passing the req in
    - First, we need to await the statusCode because we can't send any data before setting the status code

    ---

    <img src="assets/streaming-index-html-js-stream.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - Then we use a npm package, stream-template, to create a tagged template string
    - stream-template returns a node stream

    ---

    <img src="assets/streaming-index-html-js-promises.jpg" width="800">

    ???

    - It resolves the given promises and sends parts of the template to the client as soon as they are final

    ---

    <img src="assets/network-with-streaming.jpg" width="1000">

    ???

    - The advantage of this approach becomes clearly visibile in the network tab
    - The client.js is already downloaded while the response is still being rendered on the server
    - If you're using code splitting, don't forget to also include additional chunks into the head

    ### Long-term caching

    Use the [`webpack-assets-manifest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-assets-manifest) plugin to create a `manifest.json` that maps the source to dist filenames.

    ### `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`

    - Use `&lt;form method="..." action="...">`
    - Use [`method-override`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) to allow other methods than `POST`
    - Listen for `submit` events on the `document` to handle on the client side
    - Your router needs to take care of these
    - Don't forget a [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF) protection
    ]

    .slides-footnote[
    Of course, you can also decide not to support other methods than `GET` on the server side.

    ### `3xx`, `4xx` and `5xx`

    Both the server and the client entry need to take care of them.

    ### Authentication

    - The server entry needs to forward received cookies to the client
    - **Make sure that you don't accidentally share cookies between different users**

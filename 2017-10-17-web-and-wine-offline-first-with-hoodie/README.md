# Hands on Offline First! with Hoodie

These are the slides from my talk I gave at the [Web'n'Wine Meetup](http://webandwine.org) in Augsburg (Germany) which took place on 17th of October 2017 at [NFQ](http://www.nfq.de). Unfortunately the talk didn't get recorded so some slides might be hard to understand.

If you want to dig deeper I recommend you check out the [Offline First Medium publication](https://medium.com/offline-camp) which has a lot of valuable content ready for you. Also go to [offlinefirst.org](http://offlinefirst.org) where you can reach more resources and connect with the community.

This talk shares a few elements with a Talk from [Gregor Martynus](https://twitter.com/gr2m) ["Offline First Apps with Hoodie"](https://speakerdeck.com/gr2m/building-offline-first-apps-with-hoodie) [which actually got recorded, so make sure to watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSDyxtVbbME).

To create the slides I used the awesome [bespoke.js](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke) library from [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish).

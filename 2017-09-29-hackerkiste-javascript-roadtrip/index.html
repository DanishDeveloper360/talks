    ## Sion

    >We developed the Sion, a electric car with a range of 250 km and a price of 16.000 ‚Ç¨. Its integrated solar cells generate
    further energy to cover up to 30 km per day. Our vision is simple: Providing a mobility concept for a future without
    mineral oil and emissions.

    ## üöÄ Let's build it!

    ---

    ## üí° First idea: Mirroring

    - connect Android phone with Dashboard
    - open Sono App on phone
    - controllable both ways
    - Android provides Maps / Music / etc.

    ---

    ## Sounds easy, but...

    - it's only an upscaled version
    - poor usability / pixelated
    - not designed to be controlled while driving

    ---

    ## üìê Back to the drawing board...

    ---

    class: slides-chapter

    ## Betting on the web

    ---

    ## üí° Responsive PWA

    - works on Dashboard (10") and Smartphones (Android, iOS)
    - two "modes"
    - same functionality
    - a single codebase
    - synchronized on application level

    ---

    ## Downside

    - by ditching Android, the app grew more complex
    - Music and Navigation as part of the app, not the OS

    ---

    ## Planned Features

    - controls breSono (LEDs)
    - provides navigation (GPS)
    - controls the car (CAN)
      - open/close battery lid
      - lock/unlock car
    - computes cockpit information (CAN)
    - hosts a Hotspot (Wifi)
    - shares mobile data connection (LTE)

    - bridge between car and web app
    - runs a Node.js server
    - calculates estimates and triggers commands
    - sends data to the cockpit

    ## Requirements

    - we need a device which runs the web app smoothly
    - Android would be sweet (mobile platform, touch)
    - energy efficient

    ## Odroid XU4

    <img src="./assets/odroid-xu-4.jpg" style="width: 20vw" />

    - CPU: [Samsung Exynos5422 Octo Core (2.2 GHz)](http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/Solution/MobileProcessor/Exynos_5_Octa_5422.html)
    - GPU: Mali T628 OpenGL ES 3.1/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.2
    - RAM: 2Gbyte LPDDR3
    - same as Samsung Galaxy S5 (2014)
    - runs Android 7

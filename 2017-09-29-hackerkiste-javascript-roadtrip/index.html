    ## ‚òéÔ∏è The call

    ---

    >"We need an infotainment for the car we're building. It's not too complicated, just a few controls..."

    Sono Motors

    ---

    ## First draft

    <img src="./assets/first-app-draft.png" style="width: 70vh"/>

    ---

    >"That looks alright. If the car provides the required interfaces and the runtime (a Browser), we can build it." Me

    ## Wait! Sono Motors?

    ---

    ## Sono Motors

    <img src="./assets/sono-team.jpg" />

    - aims to build an affordable solar powered electric car
    - founded in 2016
    - based in Munich

    ---

    <img src="./assets/sion.jpg" />

    ---

    ## Sion

    >We developed the Sion, a electric car with a range of 250 km and a price of 16.000 ‚Ç¨. Its integrated solar cells generate
    further energy to cover up to 30 km per day. Our vision is simple: Providing a mobility concept for a future without
    mineral oil and emissions.

    ## üöÄ Let's build it!

    ---

    ## üí° First idea: Mirroring

    - connect Android phone with Dashboard
    - open Sono App on phone
    - controllable both ways
    - Android provides Maps / Music / etc.

    ---

    ## üôà Sounds easy, but...

    - it's only an upscaled version
    - poor usability / pixelated
    - not designed to be controlled while driving

    ---

    ## üìê Back to the drawing board...

    ---

    class: slides-chapter

    ## Betting on the web

    ---

    <img src="./assets/sonotainment-versions.png" style="height: 60vh;" />

    ---

    ## üí° Responsive PWA

    - a single codebase
    - platform agnostic (flexibilty++)
    - works on Dashboard (10") and Smartphones (Android, iOS)
    - almost identical functionality
    - synchronized on application level
    - OTA updates

    ---

    ## üòì Downside

    - by ditching Android, the app grew more complex
    - Music and Navigation as part of the app, not the OS
    - tight deadline

    ---
    class: slides-chapter

    ## Planned Features

    ---

    ## BreSono (illuminated moss)

    <img src="./assets/bresono-green.jpg" style="height: 40vh;" />

    - control color & brightness via app

    ---

    ## Controls for the car

    - open/close car & battery-lid
    - adjust seat heating
    - preheat battery
    - adjust interior temperature
    - lock/unlock car

    ---

    ## Information pane

    - current battery charge
    - charging rate
    - solar yield
    - distance driven
    - location

    ---

    ## Help videos

    - charging
    - carsharing
    - ridesharing

    ---

    ## Music

    - web radio integration
    - AirPlay

    ---

    ## Navigation

    <img src="./assets/feature-navigation.png" style="height: 40vh;" />

    ---

    ## Bonus: Compute cockpit data

    <img src="./assets/sion_cockpit.jpg" style="height: 50vh;" />

    ---

    ## And more...

    - host a Hotspot (Wifi)
    - share mobile data connection (LTE)
    - remote debugging capabilities
    - analytics

    ## UX / UI

    ---

    ## Worauf ist zu achten?

    ## Was machen denn die anderen?

    ---
    ## Android Auto

      <img src="./assets/android_auto.png" style="width: 30vw;" />
      <p>Android Auto Design Guidelines</p>
      <small>https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/android-auto/android-auto/introduction.html#</small>

    ## Apple CarPlay

    <img src="./assets/apple_carplay.jpg" style="width: 30vw" />
    <small>https://www.apple.com/de/ios/carplay/</small>

    ---

    - Orientierung an Material Design Guidelines / Material UI
    - einfache Bedienbarkeit
    - m√∂glichst wenig Ablenkung
    - hohe Lesbarkeit
    - Skalierung von Elementen f√ºr Tablet-Version

    ## Hardware

    ---
    class: slides-chapter

    ## Sonobox

    ---

    - bridge between car and web app
    - runs a Node.js server
    - calculates estimates and triggers commands
    - sends data to the cockpit

    ---

    ## RaspberryPi Zero W

    ## Dashboard

    ---

    ## Requirements

    - we need a device which runs the web app smoothly
    - Android would be sweet (touch support, most recent Chrome, PWA support)
    - energy efficient

    ## ‚ö° Challenges

    ---

    ## üéõÔ∏è Protoyping

    - new technolgies for everyone
    - the most agile agile you'd ever see
    - changes on a daily basis
    - estimates almost impossible
    - thinking in fallbacks

    ---

    <img src="./assets/sonobox-early.jpg" style="height: 60vh;" />

    ---

    ## üïõ DDD (Deadline driven development)

    - release dates were immutable
    - long hours and night shifts
    - JIT all the things (i.e. SION arrived 4 hours before release)
    - not enough time to ensure stability

    ---

    <img src="./assets/sion-roding-late.jpg" style="height: 60vh;" />

    ---

    ## ü§ñ Hardware !== Software

    - it takes time to deliver
    - Same Day Delivery is our friend
    - you can't just try endless devices / sensors, etc.
    - hardware is not always portable
    - testing is more challenging

    ---

    <img src="./assets/local-development-1.jpg" style="height: 60vh;" />

    ---

    <img src="./assets/local-development-2.jpg" style="height: 60vh;" />

    ---

    ## üéØ Testing

    - no _identical_ local testing setup possible (i.e. CAN)
    - Quality time with the SION was scarce (avg. 5 people working at the same time)
    - the API is able to fake everything for testing
    - BUT: You still need to test the _actual_ device
    - Try to be as flexible as possible (=> Remote development)

    ## Thank you

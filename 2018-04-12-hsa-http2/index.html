    ## HTTP 0.9

    The first version of HTTP was releases in 1991 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee as a very simple text based protocol:

    * Client sends requests as a single ASCII line terminated by CRLF (carriage return)
    * Server responds with a byte stream of ASCII characters representing the HTML document
    * The connection closes when the transfer completes or fails

    ## HTTP/1.0

    With the internet boom of the early 1990is HTTP was adopted quickly and HTTP/1.0 was standardised in May 1996 as RFC 1945.

    ---
    
    ### Major changes of HTTP/1.0
   
    - Request may contain multiple header fields separated by newline 
    - Response is prefixed with a status (i.e. 200, 404, 500)
    - Response is not limited to hypertext anymore üñºÔ∏èüé∂üé¨

    ---

    ## HTTP/1.1

    Shortly after the publication of HTTP/1.0 the successor named HTTP/1.1 was defined as RFC 2068 and finally released as RFC 2616 in 1999. 
    
    ---

    ### Major changes of HTTP/1.1
   
    - PATCH / LINK methods 
    - Connection Keep-Alive
    - Chunked encoding transfer
    - Byte-range requests 
    - Request pipelining

    ## But how about the US / Europe / ...

    <img src="./assets/lte-connections.png" style="width: 60vw" />

    ---

    ## Bandwidth doesn't matter (much)

    - latency is more important than bandwidth
    - latency might be bad, even in highly developed countries 
    - roundtrips are expensive 
    - see [Mike Belshe's Blog Post](https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2hyb21pdW0ub3JnfGRldnxneDoxMzcyOWI1N2I4YzI3NzE2)

    ## HTTP/2

    ---

    - HTTP/1.1 was standardized in 1997 (20 years ago!)
    - the web changed a lot
    - too many workarounds (i.e. domain sharding)
    - started as SPDY
    - standardized 2015

    ## Binary Transport

    <small>Source: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/</small>

    ---

    ## Binary transport

    - chunks of communication are called _frames_
    - frames belong to so-called _streams_
    - uses binary format instead of ASCII (HTTP 1.x) 
    - harder to inspect, but easier to implement and optimize

    ---

    class: slides-chapter

    ## Header Compression

    ---

    <img src="./assets/headers-example.png" style="width: 25vw;" />

    - we use many headers
    - headers are import for things like cache control, security, ...
    - _But_ headers are part of _every_ request/response

    ---

    ## Example: Average Header Size

    - Request: 0.58 kB
    - Response: 0.41 kB  
    - = 0,99 kB / Roundtrip
    - = 1kB * 80 requests (avg) 
    - = __~80,0 kB__ of header data / website

    ## Connection Multiplexing

    ---

    ## Problem 1: Head of line blocking (HOL)

    <img src="./assets/http-max-connections.png" style="width: 30vw" />

    - max 6 concurrent connections per domain
    - wait for response before dispatching next request
    - Workaround: Domain sharding i.e. img.peerigon.com

    ---

    ## Problem 2: TCP slow start

    <img src="./assets/tcp-slow-start.png" style="width: 30vw" />

    - needed to avoid congestion
    - start slow and grow until package loss
    - every TCP connection goes through slow start
    - despite available bandwidth! 

    <small>Source: https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#slow-start</small>

    ---

    ## Solution: Connection multiplexing

    - connections are expensive
    - Goal: A single connections per origin
    - Requests are multiplexed => cheap request :)
    - no more HOL

      const server = http2.createSecureServer(
        { cert, key },
        onRequest
      )

      function onRequest (req, res) {
        // Push files with index.html
        if (reqPath === '/index.html') {
          push(res.stream, 'bundle1.js') //<---------- 
          push(res.stream, 'bundle2.js') //<----------
        }
      }```

    ## Server Push

    - ability to provide data for the client in advance
    - i.e. if you request index.html, the server sends style.css too
    - loaded only if the client approves (loads the ressource)
    - not like websocket "push"

    ## Bonus: Encryption by default

    ---

    ## Encryption by default

    - not officially in the spec
    - implemented as SSL-only by all Browsers
    - _encrypt all the things!_

    ---

    class: slides-chapter

    ## Summary 

    ---

    ## Browser Support

    <img src="./assets/h2-support.png" style="width: 60vw" />

    - 85% supported 

    ---

    ## HTTP/2 vs. HTTP 1.x?

    - HTTP/2 is ready to use!
    - HTTP/1 optimizations are antipatterns when upgrading to HTTP/2
    - sending multiple requests is not a big deal anymore (i.e. polling, REST)
    - the best way to optimize HTTP 1.x is upgrading to HTTP/2!

    ---

    ## Optimizing for HTTP/2 

    - ~~Apply domain sharding~~ Minimize origins 
    - ~~Bundle resources to reduce HTTP requests~~ Prefer separate requests
    - ~~Inline small resources~~ Consider seperate requests   
    - Use server push to elmininate roundtrips
    - see https://hpbn.co/optimizing-application-delivery/#optimizing-for-http2

    ## How to upgrade? 

    ---

    ## Enable HTTP/2 for your webserver

    - Apache [mod_http2](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html)
    - nginx [blog] (https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-9-5/)
    
    ---

    ## Enable it with your provider:

    - [uberspace (v7)](ttps://uberspace.de/)
    - [zeit now](https://zeit.co/now) 
    - [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/de/about-aws/whats-new/2016/09/amazon-cloudfront-now-supports-http2/)

    ---

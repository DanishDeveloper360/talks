    ## But how about the US / Europe / ...

    ## HTTP/2

    ---

    - HTTP/1.1 was standardized in 1997 (20 years ago!)
    - the web changed a lot
    - too many workarounds (i.e. domain sharding)
    - started as SPDY
    - standardized 2015

    ---

    ## Browser Support

    ## Features

    ---

    ## Header Compression

    - we use many headers
    - headers are always sent with the request
    - we already compress the body
    - let's just compress headers too!

    ---

    ## Head of line blocking

    <img src="./assets/http-max-connections.png" style="width: 30vw" />

    - max 6 concurrent connections per domain
    - wait for response before dispatching next request
    - Workaround: Domain sharding i.e. img.peerigon.com

    ---

    ## Connection multiplexing

    - connections are expensive
    - Goal: a single connections per origin
    - Requests are multiplexed => cheap request :)
    - no more HOL

    ---

    ## HTTP/1.1

    <img src="./assets/newhttp1.png" style="width: 40vw" />

    ---

    ## HTTP/2

    <img src="./assets/newhttp2.png" style="width: 40vw" />


    ---

    ## Binary transfer / Streams

    - binary transfer instead of ASCII
    - simpler implementation, easier to multiplex using streams

    ---

    ## Server Push

    - ability to provide data for the client in advance
    - i.e. if you request index.html, the server sends style.css too
    - loaded only if the client approves (loads the ressource)
    - not like websocket "push"

    ---

    ## Ecryption by default

    - not officially in the spec
    - implemented as SSL only by all Browsers

    ## Impact on data networking

    ---

    ## HTTP/2?

    - sending multiple requests is not a big deal anymore (i.e. polling, REST)
    - workarounds are antipatterns now, i.e. domain sharding

    ---

    ## Possible "transports"

    <img src="./assets/high-level-networking.png" style="width: 40vw" />

    ---

    ## Comparison: Fetch

    <img src="./assets/load-time-batch-multiple.png" style="width: 80vw" />

    ---

    ## Comparison: Push

    <img src="./assets/publish-time.png" style="width: 50vw" />

    ---

    ## Thinks to consider

    - WebSockets are not supported within a ServiceWorker
    - WebSockets can't reuse an existing HTTP/2 connection
    - Streams spec and `fetch` are your friend
    - A single connection is what you want :)

    ## What is Meteor about

    "The JavaScript App Platform"

    ---

    ### It Really is a Platform!

    ---

    ### Meteor makes stuff easy for you by abstraction

    <img src="assets/img/webappstack-2.svg" style="max-height: 65vh; margin-bottom: 5%;"/>

    ---

    All it takes is a single command to install all of it!

    ```bash
    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    ```

    ---

    ### What? and How? (Full Stack / 1)

    - Universal JavaScript WebApps

    - Data exchange via DDP (Distributed Data Protocol) over WebSockets
      - Open protocol, keeps your data in sync
      - Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
      - Publish/subscribe model
      - Built-in latency compensation and conflict resolution

    ---

    ### What? and How? (Full Stack / 2)

    - Unified database API on server and client
      - MongoDB and MiniMongo

    - State management by reactivity
      - If a data source changes, the affected code is rerun automattically
      - Works on client and server!

    ---

    ### What? and How? (Toolchain)

    - All goodies work out of the box
      - Babel, Uglify, NPM, bundling
      - HTTP server, automatic rebuild/reload
      - Cordova (1-click export for Android &amp; iOS)

    ---

    ### Now is that cool or what?

    ---

    ### What can (or should) I use it for

    - Highly interactive WebApps
    - Rapid prototyping
    - Mobile apps

    ---

    ## The Meteor Ecosystem

    ---

    ### Ecosystem

    - Atmosphere.js
      - Package management (like NPM)

    - Meteor Galaxy
      - Cloud hosting

    ---

    ## Meteor: the past

    ### or: the errors of our youth

    <video src="assets/video/oops.mp4" autoplay loop muted />

    ---

    ### Meteor: the past

    Meteor tried to solve *everything*

    ---

    ### Meteor: the past

    The ecosystem could not keep up with the rest<br/>(esp. NPM)

    ---

    ### Meteor: the past

    Development was not fast enough,<br/>
    they got overrun by Babel, React &amp; Webpack

    ---

    ## Common Misconceptions

    ---

    ### Common Misconceptions

    - I can only integrate packages from Atmosphere.js
      - 1.3 brings NPM support via import

    ---

    ### Common Misconceptions

    - I need to use Blaze
      - You can use any frontend framework you want
      - Meteor integrates well with React, Angular, Vue

    ---

    ### Common Misconceptions

    - I cannot use Webpack

      - [but you can!](https://atmospherejs.com/webpack/webpack)

    ---

    ## Why 1.3 rocks

    ---

    ### Why 1.3 rocks

    - NPM support
    - ES2015 with Babel out of the box (server &amp; client)
      - Make sure to read the [guide to modules](http://guide.meteor.com/v1.3/structure.html#es2015-modules)

    ---

    ### Why 1.3 rocks

    - Better integration of popular frontend frameworks
    - Build system is blazing fast again
    - Still backwards compatible
    - [Full stack testing](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/testing-modules-content/content/testing.md)

    ---

    ### Why 1.3 rocks

    - It is still in the release phase (RC 5),<br/>watch out for bugs
    - Watch the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues)

    ---

    ### DEMO TIME

    ## Meteor: the future

    ---

    ### Meteor: the future

    - Upgrade from ancient Node.js to LTS-next (v6)
    - package.json
    - .meteorignore
